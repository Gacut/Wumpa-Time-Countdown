# Wumpa-Time-Countdown

After a few weeks of learning Kivy, i made my first app as a hobby project. There is a room for improvement in code for sure.

Inspiration for an app taken from webapp https://wumpa.app  by Reddit user u/Pookloo

What this app does it's accutaly pretty simple:

While playing Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled online, you have 30 minutes in a day when you will get 2x more coins per race.
It counts by your time in actual race, not time in lobby.

So basicly when you get a time in race like: 2min40sec08ms you need to input that in an app like: 24008 without any formating.

[Download for Android](https://github.com/Gacut/Wumpa-Time-Countdown/raw/master/Android/wumpa.apk) - Be sure to turn on "Unknown sources" function in phone settings

[Download for Windows](https://github.com/Gacut/Wumpa-Time-Countdown/raw/master/WumpaForWindows.7z)

NOTE: If you want to quit windows app, just pres ESC button

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:

-Text Field with '--:--:--': Here you enter your time (On android you will see normal keboard instead of numeric. It's an issue with KIVY framework)

-ADD button: Adds time to main time from Input

-Remove button: Removes last added time

-Reset button: Resets all values to default. It's like after reloading an app.
